  abstract   = {Anomalies are data points that are few and different. As a result of these properties, we show that, anomalies are susceptible to a mechanism called isolation. This article proposes a method called Isolation Forest (iForest), which detects anomalies purely based on the concept of isolation without employing any distance or density measure---fundamentally different from all existing methods.As a result, iForest is able to exploit subsampling (i) to achieve a low linear time-complexity and a small memory-requirement and (ii) to deal with the effects of swamping and masking effectively. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest outperforms ORCA, one-class SVM, LOF and Random Forests in terms of AUC, processing time, and it is robust against masking and swamping effects. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems containing a large number of irrelevant attributes, and when anomalies are not available in training sample.},

  abstract  = {This paper introduces two extensions to the popular PyTorch machine learning framework, TorchDynamo and TorchInductor, which implement the torch.compile feature released in PyTorch 2. TorchDynamo is a Python-level just-in-time (JIT) compiler that enables graph compilation in PyTorch programs without sacrificing the flexibility of Python. It achieves this by dynamically modifying Python bytecode before execution and extracting sequences of PyTorch operations into an FX graph, which is then JIT compiled using one of many extensible backends. TorchInductor is the default compiler backend for TorchDynamo, which translates PyTorch programs into OpenAI's Triton for GPUs and C++ for CPUs. Results show that TorchDynamo is able to capture graphs more robustly than prior approaches while adding minimal overhead, and TorchInductor is able to provide a 2.27\texttimes{} inference and 1.41\texttimes{} training geometric mean speedup on an NVIDIA A100 GPU across 180+ real-world models, which outperforms six other compilers. These extensions provide a new way to apply optimizations through compilers in eager mode frameworks like PyTorch.},
